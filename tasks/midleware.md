middleware is an intermediate layer between the incoming request to your application and the outgoing response. This middleware inspects the incoming requests before they reach the core logic of your application. It can perform several tasks, such as verifying user authentication, protecting the application from attacks (like CSRF attacks), logging all requests, or even checking for specific values in the requests.

it used to perform a wide range of tasks, including:

Authentication verification: Ensuring that the user is logged in before allowing access to certain pages.
Application protection: Implementing policies like Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) or limiting the size of incoming data.
Logging: Logging all requests that reach the application for analysis or tracking purposes.
